# Before ML
***To do a good job, an artisan needs the best tools.*** Before embarking on a machine learning project, we first need to set up a suitable development environment. In this section, I will describe the preparations that are made before a machine learning project is carried out. For example, acquiring a GPU, installing CUDA, configuring Miniconda and other tasks. Let's get started!

### GPU
You may ask me if I really need a GPU to train machine learning? The answer is **YES**.This graph shows how fast GPU is compared with CPU.

As you can see that GPU is 82x faster than CPU. So, it is way faster to train a modal with GPU compared with CPU. There are lots of GPU provider you can rend from. So, i am gonna leave it here and you can choose whatever GPU provider you like.
